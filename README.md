Hill Climbing is a heuristic search used for mathematical optimization problems in the field of Artificial Intelligence. 
Given a large set of inputs and a good heuristic function, it tries to find a sufficiently good solution to the problem. 
This solution may not be the global optimal maximum. 
```
* In the above definition, mathematical optimization problems implies that hill-climbing solves the problems where we need to maximize or minimize a given real function by choosing values from the given inputs. Example-Travelling salesman problem where we need to minimize the distance traveled by the salesman. 
* â€˜Heuristic searchâ€™ means that this search algorithm may not find the optimal solution to the problem. However, it will give a good solution in reasonable time.
* A heuristic function is a function that will rank all the possible alternatives at any branching step in search algorithm based on the available information. It helps the algorithm to select the best route out of possible routes.

**ADVANCE :**
- [X] Use adjacency matrix! âœ”
- [X] Built-in ***C++*** âœ”
- [X] code have comment, easily to understand âœ”
